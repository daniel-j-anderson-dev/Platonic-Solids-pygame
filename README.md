# Platonic-Solids-pygame
Render and manipulate orthographic 3D wireframe objects

rotations are calculated using quaterions

vertices are lists of 3 numbers
edges are pairs vertex indices 

All solids are controlled together
controls:
            w/s: controls y-axis rotation
            a/d: controls x-axis rotation
            q/e: controls z-axis rotation

            up arrow key/down arrow key: controls x position
            left arrow key/ right arrow key: controls y position
            Page Up/Page Down: controls z position (unused in orthographic projection)
